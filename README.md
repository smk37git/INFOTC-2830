In INFOTC-2830, I am being introduced to Web Development and Website Frameworks. Including the styling sheets, scripts,
html structures, forms, GET and PUSH, and PHP knowledge. I am incorporating many different modules to build model websites that serve a purpose!

I think that this class is great as it expands upon my foundational knowledge that I've tought myself about website design!
