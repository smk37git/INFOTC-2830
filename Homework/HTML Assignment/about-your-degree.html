        <h3 class="degree-title">Why I Choose This Field:</h3>
        <p>
            I choose IT without hesitation when it came time for college. As previously, yet minorly discussed on
            my About Me page, I built my first computer at ten years old. I have always been fascinated by technology
            and it's amazing to witness the growth of it as I grow up.
        </p>

        <p>
            My main goal for the future is to have a creative, yet stable, job in IT. I'd be happy to be any role that
            has to do with software development, programming, or system adminstration. If I could I'd love to develop
            my own business relative to IT. I've always had a passsion for starting my own thing and I interned at
            a small IT company which let me see what a small IT business looks like.
        </p>

        <p>
            The thing I find most interesting about my field is that it is constantly evolving. There is always
            something new to learn everyday which creates a challenging environment and a desire to be the best.
            Along with that, I love that the IT field is so vast. There really is a million different directions
            to go with an IT degree.

                <p>I have taken a lot of IT classes so far and even one computer science class.
                    However, there are still many more classes that I want to take. Along with the classes
                    I also want to aim for trying to get each certificate that Mizzou offers. Take a look
                    at the table on the right to see some classes that I plan on taking!

        <h3 class="degree-title">A Showcase of My Interest:</h3>
        <p>
            Over summer I was gifted an old MiniPC that I heavily refurbished. I turned it into a server
            to run video game servers, host websites, and process streaming data for live streaming. With
            upgraded RAM and an Intel i7-7700K it runs perfectly for large multiplayer servers that can be
            configured easily. I attached detachable gadgets like a 12" Screen, Keyboard, and Track Pad. All
            hard wired aesthetically into the device.
