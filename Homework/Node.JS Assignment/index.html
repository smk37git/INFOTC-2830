                    Ecuador recently just voted to reject a referendum that would've had the U.S. Military
                    reenter the country. Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa did not approve of this. Currently,
                    Ecuador is experiencing one of the worst periods of gang violence in it's history. Drug cartels
                    are turning cities into battlegrounds and murder is skyrocketing across the country. President Daniel
                    Noboa was counting on the U.S. Military returning to stablize the region. He believed that they would
                     provide better security, intelligence, training, and equipment to the Ecuadorian police and military.

                    Google just advanced it's DeepMind AlphaFold system to now analyze the structure and interactions 
                    of every life-related molecule! This is an incredible advancement as researches and simulate how drug 
                    affect human's bodies and diseases. This means they don't even need to acquire the molecules or create them in 
                    a lab. This can effectively cut research times by MONTHS. With this new development in technology, researchers 
                    have already found new ways to evolve cancer treatment and fight antibiotic resistance. Other companies
                    are starting to take notice of this technology and employing to different areas of life. One such sector is Astronomy
                    where it can analyze interactions in space. All of which is accelerating science and research by magnitude.
