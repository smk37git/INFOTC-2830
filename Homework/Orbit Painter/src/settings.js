/**
 * settings.js â€” Closure-backed configuration for Orbit Painter
 *
 * PURPOSE
 * - Demonstrate a true JavaScript closure (module-level private variables captured
 *   by returned functions) WITHOUT using a class.
 * - Provide a single source of truth for runtime configuration (speed, scale, etc.).
 *
 * WHAT YOU MUST DO IN THIS FILE
 *  1) Add at least ONE new setting and expose it through the closure:
 *     - Examples: `spawnRate` (particles per tick), `theme` (name or object).
 *     - Store it in private vars next to `speed/scale/blend`.
 *     - Return it from `get()` so renderers/sprites can read it.
 *     - Provide mutators (e.g., `adjustSpawnRate(d)`, `nextTheme()`).
 * 
 *    DONE
 *
 *  2) Enforce bounds/validation inside mutators:
 *     - Clamp numbers (e.g., `spawnRate` between 1 and 20).
 *          DONE
 *     - Cycle indices safely for theme arrays.
 *
 *  3) Keep the state PRIVATE:
 *     - Do NOT export the raw variables.
 *     - `get()` should return a fresh POJO snapshot, not live references to internal state.
 *
 *  4) Wire your new setting into the rest of the app:
 *     - In `Emitter.emitInto(...)` use `cfg.spawnRate` to decide how many particles to create.
*            DONE
 *     - In `renderer.draw(...)` use `cfg.theme` for background or styling if you add themes.
 *     - In `main.js` bind keys to your mutators (e.g., +/- to adjust spawn rate, T to cycle theme).
 *           Done for spawn rate
 *
 * INTEGRATION CHECKPOINTS (Rubric hooks)
 * - Closures: This file is your primary evidence. No `class` here.
 * - Interaction: New keys call mutators here; visuals change elsewhere based on `get()`.
 * - Code quality: Clear comments, bounds checking, and no global leaks.
 *
 * COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
 * - Returning the internal object by reference (callers could mutate it).
 * - Forgetting to clamp values, causing NaNs or runaway speeds.
 * - Introducing globals (e.g., `arr = [...]` at top-level). If you need scratch data, scope it
 *   INSIDE `makeSettings()` or delete it. Globals will be flagged during grading.
